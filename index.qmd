## Location and Date
Workshop held at the 2024 Northeast Aquaculture Conference & Exposition (NACE) and the 43rd Milford Aquaculture Seminar (MAS)

**Date:** January 10, 2024 
**Time:** 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM
**Location:** Omni Providence Hotel (1 W Exchange St, Providence, RI 02903)

**Room:** Bristol/Kent

## Description
Come learn about exciting new genomic tools for the eastern oyster that can be used to enhance aquaculture and management.  The workshop will feature lightning talks highlighting findings and applications of genomic data in aquaculture, presentations on how to non-destructively sample oysters for DNA and the benefits of incorporating genomic data. The second half of the workshop will be hands-on instruction with genomic data from the eastern oyster breeding array.
